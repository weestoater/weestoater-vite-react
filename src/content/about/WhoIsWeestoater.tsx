          I'm a father of two amazing kids and a husband to my very long
          suffering wife. We have an adorable dog called Buster and he is the
          absolutely best boy ever - spoilt and loved to bits.

          When not working or ferrying my kids to one of their many clubs, I
          like to tinker with code / websites; listen to 'rubbish' music; watch
          weird and wonderful stuff on various streaming services.

          I occassionaly make it along to see Motherwell FC too and have been
          know to strum a tune on the guitar once in a blue moon.
