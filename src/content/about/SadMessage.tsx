          Sadly in life, from time to time, we lose someone who means a great
          deal to us. In my case I've lost both my own father and my
          father-in-law. I loved them so much and they taught me so many things
          about how to be a good, caring and loving husband / father.
        </p>

        <p>
          This verse was included as part of my fathers service; it helps me and
          I hope it helps you.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Don't grieve for me for now I'm free,
          <br />
          I'm following the path God laid for me
          <br />
          I took his hand when I heard him call,
          <br />
          I turned my back and left it all
          <br />
          I could not stay another day,
          <br />
          To laugh, to love, to work or play
          <br />
          Tasks left undone must stay that way,
          <br />
          I've found that peace at the close of day
          <br />
          If my parting has left a void,
          <br />
          Then fill it with remembered joy
          <br />
          A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss,
          <br />
          Ah yes, these things I too will miss
          <br />
          Be not burdened with times of sorrow,
          <br />
          I wish for you the sunshine of tomorrow
          <br />
          My life's been full, I've savoured much,
          <br />
          Good friends, good times, my loved one's touch
          <br />
          If my time seemed all too brief,
          <br />
          Don't lengthen it now with undue grief
          <br />
          Lift up your heart, rejoice with me,
          <br />
          God wanted me now, He set me free.
          <br />
