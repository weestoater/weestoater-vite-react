          <strong>weestoater</strong> is the nickname I've used for my personal
          'playgrounds' online since 1999, when I first cut my teeth in{" "}
          <code>html</code> &amp; <code>design</code>. Since then I've gone

          <li> A hand rolled CMS on php</li>
          <li> Numerous versions of WordPress</li>
          <li> An umbraco site - didn't last long</li>
          <li> A few Angular / AngularJS versions</li>
          <li> A couple of React sites</li>

          Playwright; Jest; Testing-Libraries and multiple CSS frameworks.
