        <p>
          In early July 2019, I worked in a different team at my firm. We used
          mob programming for a variety of reasons, which I’d like to share.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team had been formed from a bunch of skills bases, some seasoned
          Java developers and some complete novices. We also had a Modern
          Apprentice, a recent University graduate and two members who came
          through a coding bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
          We shared a codebase with another team, with us focusing on mainly
          Front End tasks to begin with, then completing tasks from end-to-end.
          Using mob programming enabled us to very quickly become familiar with
          the codes architecture and share pain points.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a mob we were able to have a group understanding of the direction
          we were taking the code and tasks are completed rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Laterly, ‘specialists’ stayed off the keyboard in order to navigate
          others through tasks which they have more experience of. This was well
          received by the mob, as others were gaining hands on time doing things
          outside their comfort zone – i.e. HTML changes and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a specialist navigating others to do the HTML and CSS changes I
          found it hugely rewarding for my development. I was able to impart
          knowledge and debugging methodologies for CSS, that helped the team
          grow and ultimately led to more productive tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coupled with our ability to push back on tasks when ‘the mob’ felt
          there wasn’t enough information or there were conflicting issues and
          we had a truly powerful beast in the shape of the mob.
