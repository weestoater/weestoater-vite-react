          Over the last few sprints I’ve been allocated what should have been a
          relatively straightforward piece of work. We did our sprint planning
          and all gave it a manageable sprint score.

          Like all good adventures, first appearances were highly inaccurate.
          Between API calls; code base gremlins; lack of clarity and a laptop
          that didn’t know which way was up – it became a much more stressful
          and frustrating build that it had ever needed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          All that said, it’s been a <strong>hugely beneficial</strong> learning
          experience for me and others in the team. I’ve a far greater
          understanding of our app, the way the data is thrown around and how
          Angular works alongside JavaScript to put it all into the right places
          at the right times.

          The importance of the fabled
          <code>$q</code> is now engraved on the inside of my brain, with the
          still healing wounds of my attempts to tame <code>api services</code>{" "}
          into the viewModel.
        </p>

        <p>
          I now see the full potential of what this team can achieve. When we
          put our collective heads together and set out our clear points, we
          were cooking on gas – that’s not just what I think, but what it’s easy
          to see by the speed of the successful results. I’m going to try and
          keep a note of the lessons learned on this project – not just the
          coding patterns and Angular methods – but the interactions and
          processes we’ve seen tangible improvements from.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ll be pushing for a retrospective on this, so we can capture all
          these points and share the understanding and motivation of the changes
          we made to reach the goals.
