          I am incredibly lucky to work for a company who support and encourage
          my passion for A11y. I was promoted to Vice President for the work
          I've been doing in this area and I am now <strong>even more</strong>{" "}
          enthusiastic to prove how important it is and spread my net wider in
          the firm.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love engaging with teams and helping them discover the range of
          tools available and the steps they need to take to reach and keep A11y
          compliance. Often there are one or two developers who rise to the
          challenge and drive their team. This is the best result for everyone -
          as they can then carry the torch and keep a11y issues to a minimum.
        </p>

          I was recently told by a fresh University graduate that A11y isn't
          even mentioned during a <strong>4 year</strong> Computer Science
          degree - I am absolutely shocked to hear this as legislation has been
          in place for over 20+ years. With this in mind I am looking to become
          more involved in our Communities of Practise and POWERUP events
          internally to spread the good word and more importantly, offer
          education and advice to young or inexperienced developers.
